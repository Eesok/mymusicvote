# mymusicvote

## Project Description

A video player app that shows a variety of youtube videos that users can vote/rank. The app will display the videos dynamically based on the rankings of the users. Our main page will be a list of music videos,  but the user will have an option to sort/filter the videos based on various rankings and/or categories.
